# IBM MQ As A Service (IBMMQAAS)

IBM MQ as a service for java, I wanted a way to easily implement the IBM MQ sender and reciever and return it via a request and this as a portfolio filler/example

I wanted to demonstrate specifically the following in a dynamic way for any IBM MQ enviornment 

Servlet -> Controller -> IBM MQ Sender
Servlet -> Controller -> IBM MQ Receiver

### Current Status: 
its in progress.....(does not currently work)

### Use Case:
User to demonstrate/test IBM MQ environments for APM (Application performance monitoring) demonstrations to show tracing/examples to customers. 

### Support:
Feel free to ping me on discord @probsJustin#6785 I dont plan to update this at this point in time but I guess I could help/build/run it if you have any questions but I reserve the right to tell you I don't have space/time to help.

## Install/Run Notes:
I don't have any yet because it is not finished.
